DIAMONDPHP
=============
Diamond PHP is a fully featured framework built for PHP 7 and offers extreme performance, a modular architecture, elegant syntax and an easy to use philosophy.

### PROJECT STATUS
Diamond PHP is currently in **ALPHA** stages of development. As such, it is not recommended to use the framework in a production environment yet.
A beta version is scheduled for on December 1, 2016, and a production-ready version 1.0.0 is scheduled for public release on January 15, 2017.

### PHILOSOPHY & GOALS
Like all frameworks, Diamond PHP strives to simplify and speed up the web development process. Where Diamond PHP deviates from most frameworks
is in its emphasis on the *developer*, by creating an extraordinarily easy to learn and easy to use environment -- without sacrificing performance,
features or extensibility. A framework should help a developer by completing common tasks for the developer and providing options for other tasks,
but still being perfectly capable of "getting out of the way" when needed. A framework cannot be all things to all people, so it is important to be
able to *safely* work outside the box with minimal fuss when needed.
We think that you'll find the blazing fast performance, the ultra-light footprint, the comprehensive feature set and the emphasis on ease of use 
to be an indispensable new tool in your web development repertoire.
